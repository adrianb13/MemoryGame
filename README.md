The app was created using React.

The object of the game is to be able to choose all 12 pictures once without repeating yourself.  SO the highest possible score is 12 points since you get 1 point for each correct answer.  The moment you repeat yourself, you lose and have to start back to 0.  The catch is every time you choose a picture, they reshuffle themselves so you have to keep track of which pictures you have already chosen.

This is used to highlight the basics of React. The page was created using multiple components in React such as a Header component and gameplay compoment.
